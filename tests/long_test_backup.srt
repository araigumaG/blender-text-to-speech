In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech add on works

2
0:0:7,750 --> 0:0:11,166
Firstly, we need to install the add on

3
0:0:11,166 --> 0:0:17,833
If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator for the first time

4
0:0:17,916 --> 0:0:21,541
On linux and mac just open Blender as per usual

5
0:0:22,375 --> 0:0:29,208
We can install the add on by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file

6
0:0:30,208 --> 0:0:34,208
It might take a moment to install the text to speech library

7
0:0:35,208 --> 0:0:40,166
In linux you also need to open a terminal and copy paste the following command

8
0:0:41,166 --> 0:0:44,458
The command can be found in the video description

9
0:0:50,875 --> 0:0:55,958
When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

10
0:0:56,958 --> 0:1:2,583
If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

11
0:1:3,583 --> 0:1:8,375
In linux and mac you need to open Blender from a terminal to see any errors

12
0:1:9,375 --> 0:1:12,41
Let me know if you have any issues

13
0:1:13,41 --> 0:1:19,250
You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing Text to Speech

14
0:1:20,250 --> 0:1:25,958
Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

15
0:1:26,958 --> 0:1:31,875
Voice, pitch and rate can be chosen before converting text to speech

16
0:1:32,875 --> 0:1:39,583
Currently only text files, s.r.t and s.b.v files are supported

17
0:1:40,583 --> 0:1:45,625
If time codes are provided, audio strips will be placed at that time

18
0:1:46,625 --> 0:1:51,916
In the case of txt files, audio strips will be placed one after another

19
0:1:52,916 --> 0:2:0,666
After importing, you can move the audio strips around, delete them, and mix with individual audio strips

20
0:2:1,666 --> 0:2:9,83
You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

21
0:2:10,83 --> 0:2:16,958
You can save blender, reopen and it will remember the text associated with the audio strips for further editing

22
0:2:17,958 --> 0:2:19,875
Thanks for watching

23
0:2:20,875 --> 0:2:23,541
Let me know if you have any issues!

24
0:2:24,541 --> 0:2:24,583
