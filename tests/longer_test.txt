In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech add on works

Firstly, we need to install the add on

If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator for the first time

On Linux and Mac just open Blender as per usual

We can install the add on by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file from the add on menu

It might take a moment to install the text to speech library

In linux you also need to open a terminal and copy paste the following command

The command can be found in the video description

When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

In linux and mac you need to open Blender from a terminal to see any errors

You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing Text to Speech

Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

Currently text, csv, srt and sbv files are supported

voice

pitch 

and rate

can be chosen before converting text to speech

You can edit captions, move them around and add new ones

caption data is saved to the blendfile

You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

Thanks for watching!
