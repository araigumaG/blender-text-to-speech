In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech add on works

Firstly, we need to install the add on

If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator for the first time

On linux and mac just open Blender as per usual

We can install the add on by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file

It might take a moment to install the text to speech library

In linux you also need to open a terminal and copy paste the following command

The command can be found in the video description

When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

In linux and mac you need to open Blender from a terminal to see any errors

Let me know if you have any issues

You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing Text to Speech

Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

Voice, pitch and rate can be chosen before converting text to speech

Currently only text files, s.r.t and s.b.v files are supported

If time codes are provided, audio strips will be placed at that time

In the case of txt files, audio strips will be placed one after another

After importing, you can move the audio strips around, delete them, and mix with individual audio strips

You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

You can save blender, reopen and it will remember the text associated with the audio strips for further editing

Thanks for watching

Let me know if you have any issues!
