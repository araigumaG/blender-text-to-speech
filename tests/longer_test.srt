In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech add on works

2
0:0:7,916 --> 0:0:11,333
Firstly, we need to install the add on

3
0:0:11,333 --> 0:0:18,0
If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator for the first time

4
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:22,166
On Linux and Mac just open Blender as per usual

5
0:0:22,166 --> 0:0:30,83
We can install the add on by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file from the add on menu

6
0:0:30,83 --> 0:0:34,83
It might take a moment to install the text to speech library

7
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:39,41
In linux you also need to open a terminal and copy paste the following command

8
0:0:39,416 --> 0:0:42,708
The command can be found in the video description

9
0:0:44,375 --> 0:0:49,458
When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

10
0:0:50,958 --> 0:0:56,583
If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

11
0:0:58,208 --> 0:1:3,0
In linux and mac you need to open Blender from a terminal to see any errors

12
0:1:5,666 --> 0:1:11,875
You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing Text to Speech

13
0:1:16,291 --> 0:1:22,0
Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

14
0:1:23,125 --> 0:1:28,500
Currently text, csv, srt and sbv files are supported

15
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:31,333
voice

16
0:1:31,708 --> 0:1:33,41
pitch 

17
0:1:32,833 --> 0:1:35,0
and rate

18
0:1:34,250 --> 0:1:37,708
can be chosen before converting text to speech

19
0:1:38,375 --> 0:1:43,0
You can edit captions, move them around and add new ones

20
0:1:43,250 --> 0:1:46,666
caption data is saved to the blendfile

21
0:1:46,666 --> 0:1:54,83
You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

22
0:1:54,83 --> 0:1:56,166
Thanks for watching!
